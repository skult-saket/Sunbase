Explanation:

I use HTML to structure the carousel and products, including the necessary Bootstrap classes for styling and functionality.
CSS is used for custom styling to make the carousel visually appealing.
JavaScript is used to initialize the carousel, set the interval for automatic rotation, and enable pause on hover.
This approach leverages Bootstrap for responsiveness and styling, making it compatible with various screen sizes and devices.
